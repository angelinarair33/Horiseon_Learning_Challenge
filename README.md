# module-1-challenge-horiseon-website
## Description
This application's starter code had non-semantic elements as well as an illogical structure, so I gave it semantic elements with a tree structure. I also added alt attributes to the images/icons, plus a title attribute to the figure tag. I made sure the heading attributes were in sequential order as well. The title element has the value of "Horiseon Learning Website." I checked the CSS stylesheet to fix any issues with my changes to the index.html file and added comments to the CSS. I then added comments to the html file.
